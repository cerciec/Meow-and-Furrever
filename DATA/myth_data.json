    "myth": "Cats can't be trained."
    "truth": "While it’s certainly easier to train a dog than it is to train a cat, that doesn’t mean training a cat is impossible. You can train them to stay off certain things, perform basic tricks, and other basic tasks. You’ll find more success with positive reinforcement, and treats are pretty much always a must during training sessions."
